Calculator generator with print.

I created a simple algorithm to generate a calculator in python but with millions of elif,

I need to put some counters in this code to make each item in the first array go through the item in the second array.

I also had to put the first one as 0/0 for the sake of practicality in the code, and also because python does not divide 0/0 so complicated when it would create the 0/0 elif.
